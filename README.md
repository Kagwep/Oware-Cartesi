# Project README: Cartesi-Oware Gaming Platform

## Project Summary
Our project integrates Cartesi's Layer-2 solutions to deliver an immersive gaming environment focused on the  game Oware. By leveraging Cartesi Rollups and the Cartesi Virtual Machine (CVM), our platform offers a dynamic digital economy where players engage in AI-driven and user tournaments, enhancing engagement through ownership, trade, and competition.

## Project Overview

### Integration with Cartesi Technology
- **Cartesi Rollups**: Utilized for fast and cost-effective off-chain computations, ensuring that game mechanics and AI operations are scalable and efficient.
- **Cartesi Virtual Machine (CVM)**: Employs the CVM to develop sophisticated AI agent opponents, enabling complex computational tasks beyond the typical blockchain limitations.

### Game Dynamics
- **Secure Tournament Framework**: Smart contracts automate tournament logistics from player registrations to reward distributions, ensuring transparency and fairness.
- **Interactive Learning Module**: Features a training mode where players can learn from AI opponents, highlighting the seamless integration of Cartesi's technology.

## Scope & Methodology

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Developed using Vite, React, and TypeScript to provide a modern, responsive user interface.
- **3D Rendering**: Babylon.js is employed for its robust WebGL support, creating immersive 3D experiences directly in web browsers.

### Backend
- **AI and Game Logic**: Runs on the Cartesi Virtual Machine, leveraging Cartesi Rollups for scalable, efficient off-chain computations.
- **AI Training**: Utilizes the Keras library atop TensorFlow for training AI agents offline, ensuring a spectrum of AI competencies are developed.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **AI Engagement and Reinforcement Learning**: AI models are initially trained using Keras with varying game scenarios to establish different difficulty levels.
- **3D Model Creation**: Blender is used for creating and optimizing 3D models, integrated into the game environment via Babylon.js.

## Market Fit and User Experience
Our project taps into the growing interest in blockchain-based games and the strategic depth provided by AI, appealing to blockchain enthusiasts, strategy gamers, and fans of traditional games seeking modern twists.

### Enhancing User Experience
- **Design and Accessibility**: Focus on intuitive interfaces and accessibility, allowing easy onboarding for players without prior blockchain experience.
- **Community and Engagement**: Facilitated through achievements, tournaments, and in-game rewards, alongside active community management via forums, Discord channels, and social media.

## Tokenomics and Economic Viability
- **Digital Assets**: Players interact with digital assets (NFTs), including game pieces and AI models, enhancing engagement through strategic ownership and trade.
- **Economic Model**: Built on transparent and secure transactions via smart contracts, with sustainability supported by in-game purchases and tournament fees.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Ensuring Real-time Communication and AI Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Employing GraphQL for efficient data retrieval and updates, ensuring timely game state refreshes.
- **AI Training and Integration**: AI models are trained using scalable cloud resources, optimized for integration via TensorFlow Lite for efficient in-game execution.

## Security Measures and Fairness
- **Smart Contract Security**: Rigorous testing and audits ensure the integrity of all transactions and game dynamics.
- **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**: Ensures fairness and verifiability of game outcomes, supporting a transparent and secure gaming environment.
